Hi, my name is **Santiago Regueiro** and I am a **Technical Engineer in Business Computing Systems** from [Pontevedra](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pontevedra). 

I'm currently working as **CTO** at [Qbitia](http://www.qubitia.com), a spanish company specialized in **financial software**.
Right now we are building [Qcaid](http://qubitia.com/qcaid-corporate/), a program for designing, testing and executing 
automated trading strategies.

At work I mainly code in **Java**. During my time at **Qbitia** I have developed a market simulator, historical and real time data feeds,
quote aggregation systems and complex user interfaces. I'm interested in software architecture, the development process and team management, 
and like to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34662412-santi-regueiro) technical books on the matter.
I also experiment from time to time with functional languages like Groovy and Elixir or game development with Unreal Engine 4 and Maya.

On my free time I like watching [Tarantino](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233) or [David Lynch](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000186) movies, 
reading [Philip K. Dick](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4764.Philip_K_Dick) and [Douglas Adams](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4.Douglas_Adams), or
listening to [Rammstein](http://last.fm/music/Rammstein) and [Nine Inch Nails](http://last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails) [music](http://www.lastfm.es/user/regueiro).
The rest of the time I try to play some games, go out with my friends and practice [mountain biking](https://instagram.com/p/s4rtFkjKtD/) when the weather allows it.

You can check out [my resume](resume) or see some small side proyects at [Github](https://github.com/regueiro).
Drop me an [email](mailto:santi@regueiro.es) or go to my [contact](/contact/) page if you want to talk some more.
